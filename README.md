# **DevOps Configuration Management tool - Ansible**

## **Configuration Management**

* **Configuration Management (CM)** is an IT process that ensures all software and hardware systems maintain a consistent desired state. It automates the setup, maintenance, and tracking of servers and infrastructure, eliminating manual errors and configuration drifts.

* To be more detailed, an egineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements design and operational information throughtout its life.

* Types of Configuration Management
    * Configuration Management tools generally falls into two main operational categories based on how they apply updates:

    - Push Based Configuration Management
        * Master server pushes configuration directly to target nodes.
        * Target system do not need to pull updates.
        * Requires `SSH` or `WinRM` access to targets.
        * Example: **Ansible**.
            - **[Ansible](https://ansible.com):**
                * Architecture: Agentless.
                * Language: YAML.
                * Control: Push-based over `SSH`.
    
    - Pull Based Configuration Management
        * Agents installed on target nodes periodically check a master server.
        * Agents pull down the latest configuration if changes occur.
        * More scalable for massive environments.
        * Example: **Puppet, Chef**.
            - **[Puppet](https://puppet.com):**
                * Architecture: Agent-master.
                * Language: Puppet DSL (Domain Specific Language).
                * Control: Pull-based.
            - **[Chef](https://chef.io):**
                * Architecture: Angent-master.
                * Language: Rubby-based DSL.
                * Control: Pull-based.
            - **[SaltStack](https://saltproject.io):**
                * Architecture: Master-minion (can be agentless).
                * Language: Phython/YAML
                * Control: Speed focused push/pull via ZeroMQ.

### Ansible           

* Ansible is a open-source automation platform sponsored by Red Hat. It is highly popular due to its low barrier to entry and simple architecture.

* **Key Characteristics** 
    - **Agentless**: No software needs to be installed on target nodes.
    - **Idempotent**: Running a script multiple times yields excat same result without repeating completed tasks.
    - **Declarative/Procedural Hybrid**: You define the desired state, Ansible figures out how to achieve it.

* **Use Cases**
    - **Configuration Management**: Istall/Update package manager, manage files and services
        * Debian -> Ubuntu, debian, .. etc (`apt` package manager).
        * Redhat -> CentOS, redhat linux, amazon linux, ..etc (`yum` or `dnf`).
        * Windwos -> `choco` or `winget`.
    - **Application Deployment**: Deploys application code in multiple server.
        * Example: Deploys artifacts to tomcat webserver.
    - **Orchestration**: Ansible handles orchestration by executing automated steps in a strict, step by step order accross multiple servers form a single central machine.
        * Example: Setting up kubernetes cluster.
    - **Provisioning**: Creates resources in any cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP).

* **Core Concepts**    
    - **Control Node**: The machine where Ansible is installed and executed from.
    - **Managed/Worker Nodes**: The target servers managed by the control node.
    - **inventory**: A file (hosts) listing the IP addresses/domains of managed nodes.
    - **Modules**: Small plugins that execute specific tasks (e.g., installing a package, copying a file).
    - **Playbooks**: `YAML` file where automation tasks are defined and ordered.
    - **Ad-hoc**: Adhoc command is a single, quick task run directly from your terminal using the `ansible` command. It is used to perform immediate actions, like. checking server disk space or restarting a service-without writing a formal automation script (playbook).
        Example: `ansible all -m ping` used to check if servers are reachable.

* **Ansible Architecture**:
    ![preview](Images/ansible1.png)
    - *Note*: 
        * We need to create users and provide sudo permissions both on ansible server as well as on worker nodes.
        * Their is a file called `known_hosts` which lies inside `.ssh` directory, it is a local database that stores the unique public keys (host keys) of all remote servers you have previously connected via `ssh`.

* **Core Requirements**
    - **Control Node**: A system running Linux, MacOS, or WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) with *python 3.9* or newer installed.
    - **Ansible Package**: Installed on the control node, typically via `pip` (Python's package installer) or your OS's package manager.
    - **Target Nodes**: The remote server or devices you want to change. They only require: 
        * A running `SSH` server.
        * A user account with permissions to execute commands (and often sudo privileges of system-level changes)
        * Python3 installed (to run complex modules).
    - **Target accessibility**: The control node must be able to resolve the hostnames and IP addresses of the target node and reach them over the network (usually via port22).

#### **Ansible Environment Setup (AWS)**

##### **Using 3 ubuntu instances** (`ubuntu-ansible-server`, `ubuntu-worker-1`, `ubuntu-worker-2`)

###### **Create Ansible Server**: 
  * sign in to  the AWS Management Console.
  * Go to **EC2 Dashboard** and click Launch Instance.
  * Enter the instance name as `ubuntu-ansible-server`.
  * Select Ubuntu as operating system.
  * Choosen the required instance type (auto-selected free-tier).

###### **Configure the Key Pair**:
  * Select an exisiting key pair or create a new one.
  * A key pair is used to securely connect to your EC2 instance using `SSH`.

###### **Configure Network Settings**:
  * if you want the instance to be in a specific environment, choose the required **VPC**. Otherwise, use the default VPC.
  * Select an existing security group or create a new one.
  * Allow SSH (port 22) so you can connect to the instance.
  * if you plan to host a website, then allow:
      - HTTP (Port 80)
      - HTTPS (Port 443)

###### **Launch the Instance**:
  * Review the settings and click Launch Instance.

###### **Create Worker Nodes**:
  * Repeat the same process to create two additional Ubuntu instances
      - ubuntu-worker-1
      - ubuntu-worker-2
  * At the end of the setup, you should have, 1 Ansible Server (`ubuntu-ansible-server`) and 2 Worker Nodes (`ubuntu-worker-1` & `ubuntu-worker-2`).

###### **Connect to the Ansible Server**:
  * Use your .pem file (key) to connect to the `ubuntu-ansible-server` instance. i.e ssh -i /Users/jagadeesh/Downloads/ansible-keypair.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
  * *Note*: Before getting into further step first we need to do update and upgrade the linux system i.e `sudo apt update`

###### **Create the Anisble User**:
  * Create a new user named `ansible`, i.e `sudo adduser ansible`.
    - When prompted for a password, you can use `ansible@123` (any passwd of your choice).
    - Re-enter the password to confirm.
    - Press Enter for the remaining optional fields (Name, ..etc).
    - Type Y when asked if the infomation is correct.
    ![preview](Images/ansible2.png)

###### **Add the User to Sudo Group**:
  * `sudo adduser ansible sudo`
  * To verify if the user has been added to sudo group, give `groups ansible`

###### **Grant Passwordless Sudo Access**:
  * Create a Sudoers file:
    `sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
  * you will navigate to vim editor, now press `i` to enter insert mode and add:
    - `ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`
  * Save and exit by pressing `Esc` and type `wq!`

###### **Set Read Permissions**:
  * Now set read permissions for user and group i.e `sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
  * *Note*: Needed only for ansible control node.

###### **Enable Password Authentication for the Ansible User**:
  * Create and edit the SSH configuration file i.e `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-password-login-for-special-user.conf`
  * Add the following:
    ```nano
    Match User ansible
      PasswordAuthentication yes
    ```
    - Save the file and exit.

###### **Restart the SSH Service**:
  * `sudo systemctl restart ssh.service`

###### **Verify the configuration**:
  * From the server (ubuntu<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>), try logging in as the `ansible` user i.e `sudo ssh ansible@<PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>`. When prompted, enter the password. If the login succeeds, the configuration is working correctly.

###### **Repeat on the Worker Nodes**:
  * `ubuntu-worker-1`
  * `ubuntu-worker-2`
  * *Note*: You can skip the following command on the worker nodes i.e `sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`

###### **Install Python on All Instances**:
  * Why ansible require python on all the instances?
      * **Server Execution**: The Ansible software itself is written in Python and needs it on the server to read your playbooks and manage connections
      * **Node Execution**: Ansible works by pushing temporary scripts (modules) to the nodes; the nodes need Python to run these scripts locally.
      * **Communication**: The Python scripts running on the nodes gather system data and format the results into JSON to send back to the server.
  * Ansible uses Python on the managed (worker) nodes to execute modules and ad-hoc commands. Therefore, Python should be installed on all instances
    - Ansible Server (Control Node)
    - Worker Node 1 
    - Worker Node 2

  * **Update the Package of the OS (Ubuntu)**
    - Run the following command on each instance `sudo apt update`

  * **Install Python3 and pip**
    - `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y`, `-y` automatically answers "Yes" to the installation prompts.
    - Now verify the Python version, you should see the latest version of Python.
        * `python3 --version`

###### **Install Ansible on the Control Node**:
  * Ansible follows a push-based architecture, meaning the control node connects to worjer nodes over SSH and executes tasks remotely. Therefore, Ansible only needs to be installed on the Ansible Server (Control Node).
  * Run the following commands on Ansible Server Node:
    ```
    sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
    sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
    sudo apt install ansible -y
    ```
  * Verify the version of Ansible `ansible --version`, you should see the latest version of Ansible.
  * *Note*: 
    - The default ansible configuration will be stored in `/etc/ansible`
    - If the Ansible server was running in ubuntu machine then you can see `ansible.config`, `hosts`, `roles` files in `/etc/ansible` directory (hosts nothing but a **default** inventory file).

###### **Configure Passwordless SSH Authentication for Ubuntu Machine**    
  * To allow the Ansible to connect to worker nodes without enterning a password each time, configure SSH Key-based authentication.
  * **Generate an SSH Key Pair**
    * Log in as the `ansible` user on the Ansible Server Node and generate a new key pair i.e `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/ansible_key`, Press Enter to accept the default prompts if no passphrase is required.
    * This creates:
        - `~/.ssh/ansible_key` -> Private Key (Keep this secure on the Ansible Server)
        - `~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub` -> Public Key (copy this to worker nodes)
  * **How Ansible uses SSH**
    * Ansible expects Python on nodes; it operates primarily over SSH and Python.
    * At runtime, Ansible reads the IP addresses and credential details from the inventory file, which configures the underlying SSH connection options.
    * Ansible initiates an internal SSH connection to the target system.
    * It generates a temporary Python script containing your task configurations and copies it over to the managed node.
    * The Python interpreter on the remote node executes this temporary script.
    * The script execution output is returned to the control machine via the SSH connection.
    * Ansible automatically cleans up the temporary Python script and all related runtime files from the node.
    * As users, we interact with Ansible by writing structured playbooks or executing ad-hoc commands to orchestrate these tasks.
    * Industry standards recommend configuring a dedicated user across all target nodes using key-based SSH authentication, typically provisioned with sudo or privilege escalation rights.

###### **Copy the Public Key to Worker Nodes from Ubuntu Ansible Server**:
  * Copy the public key to worker node 1 & 2
    `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub ansible@<worker-1-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>` and `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub ansible@<worker-2-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>`. Enter the `ansible` user's password when prompted. The public key will be added to the worker node's `authorized_keys` file.
  * *Note*: Why use the <PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS> ?
    Since all instances are in the same AWS VPC. they can communicate using their private IP addresses. Using private IPs avoids issues caused by changing public IPs when re-starting the instances and also keeps traffic within the AWS network

###### **Verify Passwordless SSH Access from Ubuntu Ansible Server**:
  * From the Ansible Server, test connectivity to reach worker node i.e `ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key ansible@<worker-1-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>` and `ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key ansible@<worker-2-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>`. If the configuration is correct, you should log in without being prompted for the `ansible` user's password.
  * *Note*: If you generated the SSH Key while logged in as `ubuntu`, switch to the `ansible` user (`su ansible`) and generate the key there. This keeps the key in the `ansible` user's home directory and makes it easier for Ansible to use it.

###### **Configure the Ansible Inventory**:
  * Ansible uses an inventory file to keep track of the hosts (managed nodes) it needs to connect to. By default, the inventory file is named `hosts` and is located in the `/etc/ansible` directory.
  * **View the Default Ansible Files**
    - Log in as the `ansible` user on the Ansible Server and navigatebto the Ansible configuration directory i.e `cd /etc/ansible` and give `ls -l`. ![preview](Images/ansible3.png)
    - You should see files and directories similar to
      * `ansible.cfg`: Ansible configuration file
      * hosts`: The default inventory file where managed nodes are listed.
      * `roles/`: Directory used for organizing Ansible roles.

###### **Add Worker Nodes to the Inventory (hosts)**:
  * Open the default inventory file i.e `sudo vi hosts`. At the bottom of the file, add the private IP addresses of your worker nodes: (Save and Exit the file)
    - WORKER-1-PRIVATE-IPADDRESS
    - WORKER-2-PRIVATE-IPADDRESS
        
###### **Test Connectivity with an Ansible Ping**:
  * Once the inventory is configured, you can verify that Ansible can connect to all managed nodes by running the `ping` module i.e `ansible all -m ping --user ansible --private-key ~/.ssh/ansible_key`.

    * **Explanation of the Command**
      - `all`: Targets all hosts listed in the inventory file (`/etc/ansible/hosts`).
      - `-m ping`: Uses Ansible's built-in `ping` modules to check connectivity. This is not an ICMP network ping; it verifies that Ansible can log in and execute Python on the remote hosts.
      - `--user ansible`: Connects to the remote machines using the `ansible` user.
      - `--private-key ~/.ssh/ansible_key`: Uses the specifies SSH private key for authentication.
        
    * **Authentication Methods**
      - Ansible supports multiple ways to authenticate with remote hosts:
        * **1. Password Based Authentication**:
          - `ansible all -m ping --user ansible --ask-pass`, with this methodd you will be prompted to enter the user's password.
        * **SSH Key based authentication**:
          - `ansible all -m ping --user ansible --private-key ~/.ssh/ansible_key`, This method uses the SSH key pair configured earlier and avoids entering a password each time.
        
      - *Note*: If you are using a custom inventory file (for example, `inventory.ini`) instead of the default `hosts` file, specify it with the -i option i.e `ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping --user ansible --private-key ~/.ssh/ansible_key`

      - The response when running above command looks like ![preview](Images/ansible4.png)

##### **Setting Up a Mixed Ansible Environment**
  * The environment setup for 
    - `redhat-ansible-server`
    - `ubuntu-worker-1` 
    - `redhat-worker-2`

  * In this section, I am demonstrating the configuration only for the RedHat instance. You can apply the same configuration steps to the RedHat worker node as well. For the Ubuntu worker node, follow the Ubuntu specific configuration steps provide in previous sections. 

  * In this setup, we will use: 
    - Ansible Server (Control Node): Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
    - Worker Node 1: Ubuntu
    - Worker Node 2: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
    - *Note*: The overall process is same as before. The main difference are the package manager (`apt` vs `dnf`) and the default SSH user for each operating system.

###### **Connect to the Ansible Server**:
  * Use your .pem file (key) to connect to the `redhat-ansible-server` instance. i.e ssh -i /Users/jagadeesh/Downloads/ansible-keypair.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
  * *Note*: Before getting into further step first we need to do update and upgrade the linux system i.e `sudo dnf update`

###### **Create the Anisble User**:
  * Create a new user named `ansible`, i.e `sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash ansible` and `sudo passwd ansible` for password setup, you can use `ansible@123` (any passwd of your choice) and re-enter the password to confirm.
    - `sudo`: Run the command with administrator (root) privileges.
    - `useradd`: Creates a new user account.
    - `-m`: Creates a home directory for the user 
    - `-s /bin/bash`: Sets the user default login shell to bash (`/bin/bash`).
    - `ansible`: The name of the user being created.

###### **Add the User to Sudo Group**:
  * `sudo usermod -aG wheel ansible`
  * To verify if the user has been added to sudo group, give `groups ansible`

###### **Grant Passwordless Sudo Access**:
  * Create a Sudoers file:
    - `sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
  * you will navigate to vim editor, now press `i` to enter insert mode and add:
    - `ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`
  * Save and exit by pressing `Esc` and type `wq!`

###### **Set Read Permissions**:
  * Now set read permissions for user and group i.e `sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
  * *Note*: Needed only for ansible control node.

###### **Enable Password Authentication for the Ansible User**:
  * Create and edit the SSH configuration file i.e `sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf`
  * Add the following:
    ```
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    ```
  * Save the file and exit.

###### **Restart the SSH Service**:
  * `sudo systemctl restart sshd`

###### **Verify the configuration**:
  * From the server (ec2-user<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>), try logging in as the `ansible` user i.e `sudo ssh ansible@<PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>`. When prompted, enter the password. If the login succeeds, the configuration is working correctly.

###### **Repeat on the Worker Nodes**:
  * `redhat-worker-1`
  * `ubuntu-worker-2` -> Please following ubuntu instance configuration setup
  * *Note*: You can skip the following command on the worker nodes i.e `sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/ansible` 

###### **Install Python on All Instances**:
  * Ansible requires Python to be installed on all managed nodes to execute tasks remotely.
  * Update the package list i.e `sudo dnf update -y` for RedHat and `sudo apt update` for Ubuntu.
  * Install Python3 and pip
    * RedHat
      - `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip -y`
    * Ubuntu
      - `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y`
  * Verify the installation i.e `python3 --version`

###### **Install Ansible on the Control Node**:
  * Install Ansible only on the RedHat Ansible Server. The worker nodes only require Python i.e `sudo dnf install ansible-core -y` and verify the installation i.e `ansible --version`.

###### **Configure Passwordless SSH Authentication for Redhat Machine**:
  * To allow the Ansible Server to connect to the worker nodes without prompting for a password, configure SSH key-based authentication.
  * [Follow the steps mentioned under passwordless ssh authentication for ubuntu machine](#configure-passwordless-ssh-authentication-for-ubuntu-machine).

###### **Copy the Public Key to Worker Nodes from RedHat Ansible Server**:
  * [Follow the steps mentioned under copy the public key to worker nodes from ubuntu ansible server](#copy-the-public-key-to-worker-nodes-from-ubuntu-ansible-server)

###### **Verify Passwordless SSH Access from Redhat Ansible Server**:
  * [Follow the steps mentioned under verify passwordless ssh access from ubuntu ansible server](#verify-passwordless-ssh-access-from-ubuntu-ansible-server).

###### **Configure the Ansible Inventory**:
  * Unlike the Ubuntu package, installing Ansible on RedHat may not create the `/etc/ansible/` directory or a default `hosts` inventory file. A simple alternative is to create your own project directory and maintain a custom inventory file.

  * **Create a Directory for Ansible Files**: Create a directory to store your inventory and ansible related files i.e `mkdir -p ~/ansible` -> `cd ~/ansible`

  * ***Create a Custom Inventory File**: Create a file named `inventory.ini` i.e `nano ~/ansible/inventory.ini`.

    * *Note*: if `nano` is not installed, install it using `sudo dnf install nano -y`.

    * Add your worker nodes using their private IPADDRESSES to `inventory.ini` file

    ```
    [nodes]
    <REDHAT_WORKER_PRIVATE_IPADDRESS> ansible_user=ansible
    <UBUNTU_WORKER_PRIVATE_IPADDRESS> ansible_user=ansible
    ```
  * **Test Connectivity**: Run the following commang from the Ansible Server to verify connectivity.
    `ansible -i inventory.ini all -m ping --user ansible --private-key ~/.ssh/ansible_key`. ![preview](Images/ansible5.png)

  * **Simplify the Configuration (Optional)**: Instead of specifying the SSH user and private key in every command, you can define them once in the inventory file and run `ansible -i inventory.ini all -m ping --user ansible`. Use this `ansible -i inventory.ini all -m ping --user ansible --private-key ~/.ssh/ansible_key` when you get a ssh error i.e ![preview](Images/ansible6.png)

  ```
  [nodes]
  <REDHAT_WORKER_PRIVATE_IPADDRESS> ansible_user=ansible
  <UBUNTU_WORKER_PRIVATE_IPADDRESS> ansible_user=ansible    

  [all:vars]
  ansible_user=ansible        
  ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ansible_key
  ```

#### Package Managers
  * **Methods to Install Software in Linux**
    - Source Code Compilation: Building binaries manually using source `code + make`.
    - Low-Level Packages: Installing offline packages directly using system utilities.
      * Debian/Ubuntu: `dpkg -i <package>.deb`
      * Red Hat/CentOS: `rpm -ivh <package>.rpm`
    - **Package Managers**: Automated tools that resolve and download dependencies from remote repositories.
      * Debian/Ubuntu: `apt`
      * Red Hat/CentOS: `dnf` (`yum`)
      * Universal: `snap` (containerized software packages)
  * **Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)**
    - The default package manager used across all Debian and Ubuntu-based Linux distributions.
    - Downloads the latest metadata package definitions from remote repositories via `apt update`.
    - **Software Installation**: Resolves underlying dependencies and installs software using `apt install <package-name>`.
  * **Dandified YUM (DNF)**
    - The default package manager used across Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Fedora, and Rocky Linux systems.
    - Refreshes metadata automatically during commands, or explicitly via `dnf check-update`
    - **Software Installation**: Resolves underlying dependencies and installs software using `dnf install <package-name>`.

##### **Manual steps in setting up a website with Nginx (Ubuntu/Redhat)**
  * **Instance Launching and Networking**
    - Create an Ubuntu and a RedHat instance named `ubuntu-nginx-man-1` and `redhat-nginx-man-1` (or use names of your choice). Assign an existing PEM file if you have one; otherwise, create a new one.

    - Enable **HTTP(80)**, **HTTPS(443)** for in-bound traffic under firewall (security groups) settings and launch instance.
        * *Note*: Port 80 is the global standard for unencrypted web traffic (HTTP). Port 443 handles encrypted web traffic (HTTPS). If these ports are closed in your cloud firewall, users cannot access your website even if Nginx is running.
  * **Secure SSH Remote Access**:
    - Now login into your remote instance using local terminal and private key 
        * Ubuntu: `ssh -i /Users/jagadeesh/Downloads/ansible-keypair.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>`
        * RedHat: `ssh -i /Users/jagadeesh/Downloads/ansible-keypair.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>`
  * **System Update and User Management**:
    - Update your system packages before going to next steps
        * Ubuntu: `sudo apt update`
        * RedHat: `sudo dnf update -y`
  * **Nginx Web Server Installation**:
    - Install the web server engine and verify that the background service is running.
        * Ubuntu:
        ```
        sudo apt install nginx -y
        sudo systemctl status nginx
        ```
        * RedHat:
        ```
        sudo dnf install nginx -y
        sudo systemctl status nginx
        ```
    - *Note*: **Nginx** is a high-performance HTTP web server. **systemctl** is the controller utility for systemd, which manages system services (daemons) running in the background of Linux.
  * **Dependency & Utility Installation**:
    - Install the package tools required to download and extract web source files.
        * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install unzip wget -y`
        * RedHat: `sudo dnf install unzip wget -y`
  * **Website Artifact Retrieval**:
    - Navigate to a temporary workspace (`/tmp/`) to download and extract the template files.
        ```
        cd /tmp/
        wget https://templatemo.com/tm-zip-files-2020/templatemo_589_lugx_gaming.zip
        unzip templatemo_589_lugx_gaming.zip
        ```
    - *Note*: Files stored here (`/tmp`) are temporary and usually cleared automatically when the system reboots.
  * **Web Root Deployment**:
    - Move your unzipped static files into Nginx’s default public-facing directory.
        ```
        cd templatemo_589_lugx_gaming/
        sudo cp --recursive . /var/www/html/
        ```
    - *Note*: **Web Root (/var/www/html)**
        * `/var/www/html` is the default folder where Nginx looks for website files (like `index.html`)
        * `--recursive` (or `-r`) flag tells Linux to copy everything inside the folder, including all nested subdirectories and assets.
  * Now open your browser and check whether you are able to reach the Nginx homepage. `http://<your-server-public-ip>`
    - *Note*: you can use `curl ifconfig.me` to find your public IP address without navigating to cloud ec2 console.

#### **Ansible Modules and Their Types**
  * [Ansible Modules official Document](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html)
  * **System & Package Management**:
    - `ansible.builtin.package`: Generic manager that automatically calls apt or dnf based on the target OS.
    - `ansible.builtin.apt`: Manages packages on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
    - `ansible.builtin.dnf`: Manages packages on Red Hat/RHEL systems.
    - `ansible.builtin.service / systemd`: Starts, stops, restarts, and enables background system services.
  * **Files & Templating**
    - `ansible.builtin.copy`: Copies files from the control machine directly to target nodes.
    - `ansible.builtin.template`: Processes Jinja2 templates (.j2) dynamically before moving them to nodes.
    - `ansible.builtin.file`: Sets permissions, ownership, symlinks, and creates directories.
    - `ansible.builtin.lineinfile`: Searches for, adds, updates, or deletes a specific single line inside a text file.
  * **Users & Permissions**
    - `ansible.builtin.user`: Creates, updates, or removes system user accounts.
    - `ansible.builtin.group`: Manages system group access.
  * **Execution & Commands**
    - `ansible.builtin.command`: Runs safe, raw commands on nodes (does not support shell piping or variables)
    - `ansible.builtin.shell`: Executes free-form commands through the node's shell (supports |, <, >, and variables).
  * **Networking & Utilities**
    - `ansible.builtin.get_url`: Downloads files over HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP directly to target nodes.
    - `ansible.builtin.unarchive`: Unpacks compressed files (like .tar.gz or .zip) on target nodes.
    - `ansible.builtin.setup`: Automatically collects detailed hardware and software facts from nodes.

#### **YAML**
  * **Ansible Execution Modes**
    - Ad-hoc Commands: Quick, single-task terminal commands targeting a specific module.
    - Playbooks: Structured, declarative configuration files written in YAML format.
  * **YAML Core Principles**
    - Structure: Uses key-value pairs separated by a colon and a space (key: value)
    - Formatting: Relies strictly on Python-inspired indentation (spaces, no tabs).
    - Files: Uses .yml or .yaml extensions and begins with a document start marker (---).
  * **YAML Data Types & Syntax Examples**
    - [Learn YAML in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/yaml/)
    - **Simple Types**
      * Text: Can be unquoted, single-quoted, or double-quoted.
        ```yaml
        name: Quality Thought Technologies
        ```
      * Number: Written as integers or floats without quotes.
        ```yaml
        age: 13
        ```
      * Boolean: Evaluated via lowercase or capitalized true/false values.
        ```yaml
        offline: true
        ```
    - **Complex Types**
      * List / Array: Ordered collections written inline or as hyphenated bullet points.
        ```yaml
        courses: [DevOps, Python]
        # OR
        courses:
          - DevOps
          - Python
        ```
      * Map / Object: Nested dictionary key-value mappings written inline or indented.
        ```yaml
        address: { flatno: 601, city: hyderabad }
        # OR
        address:
          flatno: 601
          city: hyderabad
        ```

#### **Ansible Playbooks**
  * A declarative configuration file written in YAML that outlines the exact state you want your target servers to be in.
  * A playbook is a collection of one or more plays.
  * **Structure of a Play**
    - `hosts`: Specifies the target nodes or inventory groups where the tasks will execute.
    - `become`: Enables privilege escalation (e.g., executing commands via sudo). It can be applied globally to a play or specifically to an individual task.
    - `tasks`: A sequential list of actions to execute. Each task invokes exactly one Ansible module.
    - `roles`: Bundled, reusable structures of tasks, variables, and handlers organized into directories.
    - `handlers`: Special tasks triggered by other tasks using notify, typically used for service restarts only when changes occur.
  * **Execution & Testing**
    - Dry Run Syntax: Evaluates the playbook and shows what would change without modifying the target systems.
      ```bash
      ansible-playbook --check -i inventory.ini playbook.yaml
      ```
    - Syntax Check: Validates the YAML and Ansible layout structure before execution.
      ```
      ansible-playbook --syntax-check -i inventory.ini playbook.yaml
      ```
  * **Task Execution Status Codes**
    - Ansible returns a real-time status summary at the completion of every single task:
      * `ok`: The system is already in the desired state. No changes were made (Idempotency).
      * `changed`: Ansible modified the remote system to match your declared task parameters.
      * `failed`: The task encountered an error and halted execution on that host.
      * `skipped`: The task was bypassed because a conditional evaluation (when statement) was not met.


##### **Automating the website deployment using ansible-playbook (redhat ansible server) and manipulate worker nodes (redhat:httpd & ubuntu:apache2)**
  * [Follow the steps provided under setting up a mixed ansible environment](#setting-up-a-mixed-ansible-environment) upto copying ssh public key to the worker nodes.

  * *Note*: While creating worker instances (redhat and ubuntu) try to enable http and https from anywhere under security group in-bound rules.

  * While installing ansible server in redhat machine it won't create a default ansible directory so try to create `mkdir -p ~/ansible` and then add invintory.ini file inside it. Similarly, we need to add our ansble-playbook in the same directory (**sign-up as ansible user in control node and perform these commands**).
  
  * **Configure Inventory File** 
    - Instead of calling the user and ssh private key while running ansible-playbook we can provide that in inventory file i.e `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini httpd.yaml --user ansible --private-key ~/.ssh/ansible_key` or run this `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini httpd.yaml` if you specify ssh in inventory.ini 

    - `/ansible/inventory.ini` file looks like:
        ```ini
        #inventory.ini

        [redhat_nodes]
        172.31.39.20 user=ansible

        [ubuntu_nodes]
        172.31.44.85 user=ansible

        [all:vars]
        ansible_user=ansible        
        ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ansible_key

        ```
    - `/ansible/httpd.yaml` here we want to deploy website to **RedHat instance** using **httpd** webserver. After playbook is done try to run `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini httpd.yaml`

        * **Note**: This playbook is only for redhat worker. 

        ```yaml
        ---
        - name: Host a Gaming Website using httpd webserver on redhat machine
        hosts: redhat_nodes

            - name: Download gaming html
            ansible.builtin.get_url:
                url: https://templatemo.com/tm-zip-files-2020/templatemo_589_lugx_gaming.zip
                dest: /tmp/templatemo_589_lugx_gaming.zip
                mode: '0755'

            - name: unzip templated in apache html
            ansible.builtin.unarchive:
                src: /tmp/templatemo_589_lugx_gaming.zip
                dest: /tmp/
                remote_src: true

            - name: copy files
            ansible.builtin.copy:

                dest: /var/www/html/
                remote_src: true
                owner: apache        # Changed from www-data to apache for redhat
                group: apache        # Changed from www-data to apache for redhat
                mode: '0755'

            - name: Restore SELinux contexts on web root (Fixes 403 Forbidden)
            ansible.builtin.command:
                cmd: restorecon -R /var/www/html
            changed_when: false

            - name: restart service apcahe
            ansible.builtin.systemd_service:
                name: httpd
                enabled: yes
                state: restarted
        ```
    * On RedHat Rocky Linux, and AlmaLinux, security is managed by a system called **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**

    * The `restorecon` command tells Red Hat to "Look at all the files in /var/www/html and give them the correct security labels so the web server can read them.

    * The steps completely mandatory for Red Hat:
        - 1. Files carry "Hidden Tags" (SELinux Contexts) Every file on Red Hat has a hidden security label. You can view these labels by running `ls -Z`. 
            * Files inside `/tmp/` get a tag called `tmp_t` (meaning: Temporary file). 
            * Files inside `/var/www/html/` must have a tag called `httpd_sys_content_t` (meaning: Web server file).
        - 2. When your ansible playbook downloads and unzips the template into `/tmp/`, the files are tagged as `tmp_t`. When Ansible copies those files into `/var/www/html/`, they keep their old `tmp_t` tags.
        - 3. **Apache Gets Blocked**
            - Apache (`httpd`) on Red Hat runs in a strict security sandbox. It looks at the files you just copied, sees the `tmp_t` (temporary) tag, and says: "I am a web server. I am not allowed to open temporary system files."
            - Even if your Linux permissions are set perfectly to `0755` or `0644`, SELinux overrides them and blocks Apache, which results in a `403 Forbidden` error or broken CSS/images
        **Usage of the command**:
            - `restorecon`: Stands for "Restore Context". It resets the hidden security tags back to their default values based on where the file lives.
            - `-R`: Means Recursive. It fixes the main folder and every single subfolder and file inside it (like your CSS, JavaScript, and images).
            - `changed_when`: false: This is just for Ansible. Because restorecon is a raw Linux command, Ansible will always report it as a "Yellow / Changed" task. Adding this line forces Ansible to keep it "Green / OK" so your playbooks look clean

#### **Ansible Inventories**
  * A configuration source containing a list of target hosts, IP addresses, and connection settings that Ansible manages.
  * **Default Location**: /etc/ansible/hosts (used if no custom inventory file is passed via the -i flag).
  * **Implicit Group**: Ansible automatically catches all defined hosts under a built-in parent group named all.

##### **Inventory Types**
  * **Static Inventories**: Plain text files with hardcoded server addresses (written in either INI or YAML format).
  * **Dynamic Inventories**: Executable scripts or cloud plugins (AWS, GCP, Azure) that fetch live server lists automatically and output them in a standard JSON format.
  * **INI Format vs YAML Format Syntax**
    * Basic Structure (Ungrouped)
      - INI Format (`inventory.ini`)
        ```ini
        10.100.0.11
        10.100.0.12
        ```
      - YAML Format (`inventory.yaml`)
        ```yaml
        ---
        all:
          hosts:
            10.100.0.11:
            10.100.0.12:
        ```
    * Grouped Layout: To define distinct logical boundaries for applications (like web and database layers), group names are configured as children in YAML or bracketed headers in INI.
      - INI Format (`inventory.ini`)
        ```ini
        [webservers]
        10.100.0.11
        10.100.0.12

        [dbservers]
        10.100.0.17
        10.100.0.18
        ```
      - YAML Format (`inventory.yaml`)
        ```yaml
        ---
        all:
          children:
            webservers:
              hosts:
                10.100.0.11:
                10.100.0.12:
            dbservers:
              hosts:
                10.100.0.17:
                10.100.0.18:
        ```
    * Range Patterns
      - INI Format 
        ```ini
        [webservers]
        www[01:06].example.com
        ```
      - YAML Format
        ```yaml
        webservers:
          hosts:
            www[01:06].example.com
        ```
#### **Failing and Bailing Out of Playbooks**
  * `ansible.builtin.fail`: Explicitly stops playbook execution on the current host and marks the task as failed. It is combined with when conditionals to halt operations if safety requirements or pre-requisites are not met.
  * `ansible.builtin.meta`: Used to bail out or end execution gracefully without marking the run as a failure.
    * `ansible.builtin.meta: end_play`: Bails out of the current play 
    for the host without throwing an error.
    * `ansible.builtin.meta: end_host`: Bails out of the entire playbook completely for the host without throwing an error.
  * `any_errors_fatal`: A play-level keyword. Setting `any_errors_fatal: true` forces Ansible to instantly stop the entire playbook run across all hosts if even a single server fails a task.
  * **Examples**:
    - Failing Hard:
      ```yaml
      - name: Verify OS is supported
        ansible.builtin.fail:
          msg: "This playbook only supports RedHat and Debian families!"
        when: ansible_os_family not in ['RedHat', 'Debian']
      ```
    - Graceful Bailout:
      ```yaml
      - name: Skip remaining tasks if software is already configured
        ansible.builtin.meta: end_host
        when: software_already_installed | default(false)
      ```

#### **Variables and Types of variables**
  * [Refer here for official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html)
  * **Inventory Variables (`group_vars` and `host_vars`)**
    - These are used to separate environment configurations (like Dev, QA, or Prod) directly within your inventory structure.
      * Group Variables (`group_vars/`): Applied to an entire collection of servers.
      ```yaml
      # group_vars/ubuntu_nodes.yml
      java_package: "openjdk-21-jdk"
      ```
      * Host Variables (host_vars/): Applied strictly to a single, specific server machine.
      ```yaml
      # host_vars/private_ip_1.yml
      tomcat_port: 8081 # Unique port just for this node
      ```
  * **Playbook Variables (`vars` and `vars_files`)**
    - Variables declared directly inside your automation play files.
      * Play Variables (`vars`): Written at the top of a play block.
      ```yaml
      - name: Install Tomcat
        hosts: all
        vars:
          tomcat_user: "tomcat"
      ```
      * Variable Files (`vars_files`): Loaded dynamically from external files, often used to separate configurations by OS.
      ```yaml
      vars_files:
        - "vars/{{ ansible_os_family }}.yml"
      ```
  * **Role Variables (`defaults` vs `vars`)**
    - When writing reusable [Ansible Roles](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html), variables are split by how easily they should be overridden.
      * Role Defaults (`defaults/main.yml`): The lowest priority variables. They act as safe fallbacks that users can easily overwrite.
      * Role Vars (`vars/main.yml`): High priority variables critical to the role's internal logic that should rarely be changed.
  * **System Facts / Gathered Variables**
    - These are discovered automatically by Ansible from the target node at the start of a playbook run via the `setup` module.
      * Used to make choices based on hardware or OS details.
      * **Examples**: `ansible_os_family` (e.g., RedHat, Debian), `ansible_memtotal_mb`, or `ansible_ip_addresses`.
  * **Extra Variables (`extra_vars`)**
    - Variables passed directly on the command line at runtime. They hold the absolute highest priority and override all other definitions.
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook tomcat.yaml -e "chosen_servers=ubuntu_nodes tomcat_port=9090"
    ```
  * **Task Variables**
    - Variables defined directly inside a specific task block. They are only visible to that single task.
    ```yaml
    - name: Download file
      ansible.builtin.get_url:
        url: "{{ download_url }}"
      vars:
        download_url: "https://example.com"
    ```
  * **Registered Variables**
    - One of the most powerful features in Ansible is the ability to capture the output of a task and use it later in the playbook. The register keyword stores the entire result of a task into a variable, giving you access to return codes, stdout, stderr, changed status, and module-specific data. This is essential for building playbooks that make decisions based on the actual state of the system rather than assumptions.
    - **Example**:
        ```yaml
        - name: check disc usage    
        ansible.builtin.command: df -h /
        register: disk_output

        - name: show disk info
        ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "Worker Node Disk Info:\n{{ disk_output.stdout }}"        
        ```
        * **Explaination**:
          - *Target List*: At the very top of your playbook, you wrote hosts: . This tells Ansible, "Look inside my inventory file and get the IP addresses from those two groups."
          - *Loop*: Ansible reads your inventory.yaml and sees the two IPs (10.0.0.5 and 10.0.0.6). It automatically loops through them.
          - *Isolation*: When running the check disc usage task, Ansible logs into the first IP, runs df -h, and saves the result only for that IP. Then it immediately logs into the second IP, runs df -h, and saves the result only for that second IP.
    - Think of your playbook as a reusable template. You write the steps just once, and Ansible handles the hard work of repeating those steps for every single IP address it finds in your inventory file.

  * **Ansible Variable Precedence Hierarchy**

    * Ansible resolves conflicting variable names using a strict hierarchy. If the same variable is defined in multiple places, the source with the **higher priority number** overrides the lower ones.

    | Priority | Source / Location | Scope & Common Usage |
    | :---: | :--- | :--- |
    | **1 <br> (Lowest)** | `defaults/main.yml` | Base fallback values inside an Ansible role. Easily overridden. |
    | **2** | Inventory file `[group:vars]` | Variables defined inside a static INI/YAML inventory file for a group. |
    | **3** | Inventory file host vars | Variables defined next to a specific host IP/name inside the inventory file. |
    | **4** | Playbook `group_vars/` | Variables stored in external YAML files matching group names next to the playbook. |
    | **5** | Playbook `host_vars/` | Variables stored in external YAML files matching specific hostnames next to the playbook. |
    | **6** | Playbook `vars:` block | Explicitly declared under the main play header. |
    | **7** | Playbook `vars_files:` block | Loaded dynamically from external files listed at the play level. |
    | **8** | Playbook `vars_prompt:` block | Interactive inputs requested from the terminal user before the play starts. |
    | **9** | Task-level `vars:` block | Scoped tightly inside a single, specific task. |
    | **10** | `set_fact` / `register` vars | Created dynamically during runtime by a task execution. |
    | **11 <br> (Highest)** | Extra vars (`-e`) | Passed directly on the command line at runtime. Overrides everything. |


##### **Configuring apache webserver on redhat (httpd) and ubunut (apache2) in parllel and hosting a gaming website dynamically.**

  * configure the custom hosts file i.e inventory file
    - *Note*: when you use yaml format try to save the inventory file with `.yaml` extension i.e `inventory.yaml`
    - **ini format**
    ```ini
    [redhat_nodes]
    172.31.21.38

    [ubuntu_nodes]
    172.31.18.24

    [all_workers:children]
    redhat_nodes
    ubuntu_nodes

    [all:vars]
    ansible_user=ansible
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ansible_key
    ```
    - **yaml format**
    ```yaml
    all:
      children:
        redhat_nodes:
          hosts:
            172.31.21.38
        ubuntu_nodes:
          hosts:
            172.31.18.24
      vars:
        ansible_user: ansible
        ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/ansible_key
    ```
  * We can add names infront of the ips and do `alias` i.e we can call using worker1 and worker2
    ```ini
    [redhat_nodes]
    worker1 ansible_host=172.31.21.38

    [ubuntu_nodes]
    worker2 ansible_host=172.31.18.24 
    ```
  * Now configure ansible playbook named `apache.yaml`
    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Deploying Gaming Website
    hosts: "{{ chosen_servers | default('redhat_nodes,ubuntu_nodes') }}" # you can choose "all" so the playbook runs for all hosts, here i want to pass the hosts distribution from command `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml apache.yaml -e "chosen_servers=redhat_nodes"`

  * This playbook deploys a website to the worker nodes by passing values dynamically `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml apache.yaml -e "chosen_servers=redhat_nodes"`, if you want to deploy to all the node then use `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml apache.yaml`
    - In Ansible, the `-e` flag (short for `--extra-vars`) is used to pass variables into a playbook directly from the command line at runtime.
    - It has the highest priority in Ansible, meaning any variable you pass using -e will override variables defined anywhere else (such as in the playbook, group vars, host vars, or roles).

  * SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a built-in Linux security system that controls process permissions. [Refer **Security-Enhanced Linux** if you face 403 Errors for RedHat Machine](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html-single/security-enhanced_linux/index)

#### Ansible Facts
  * Ansible facts are system properties and metadata collected automatically from target nodes before tasks execute.
    - Handled by the `ansible.builtin.setup` module when `gather_facts: true` is set.
    - Used to dynamically adjust configurations based on OS types, IP addresses, memory, or storage layouts.
  * **Examples**:
    * Target System's IP Address (`ansible_default_ipv4`): Perfect for dynamically assigning listen addresses in configuration files.
    ```yaml
    - name: Output the default private IP address
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "The node primary IP address is {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"
    ```
    * Available Memory (`ansible_memtotal_mb`): Useful for dynamically calculating application configurations like Java heap sizing.
    ```yaml
    - name: Set dynamic Java heap size based on total RAM
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        jvm_heap_size: "{{ (ansible_memtotal_mb * 0.5) | int }}m"
    ```
    * CPU Core Count (`ansible_processor_vcpus`): Used to scale worker thread counts to match infrastructure capacity.
    ```yaml
    - name: Display total CPU count
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "This server has {{ ansible_processor_vcpus }} virtual CPUs"
    ```
#### **Ansible Conditionals (when)**
  * Conditionals control whether a specific task executes or gets skipped based on evaluated criteria.
    - `Rule`: Do not use Jinja2 brackets {{ }} inside a when statement; variables are evaluated implicitly.
##### **Manual steps to install Apache Tomcat 10 with openjdk 21 on Ubuntu instance**
  * Create a ubuntu instance naming `ubuntu-tomcat-manual` (or choose name of your choice) and attach existing .pem key or create one if you dont have one and then enable `http(80)` and `https(443)` protocals. Later after launching instance try to edit inbound security rule enable `port 8080` since tomcat runs on port 8080. 

  * Now `ssh` into the ubuntu machine using <PUBLIC_IPADDRESS> i.e `ssh -i /User/jagadeesh/Downloads/ansible-keypair ubuntu@54.90.239.250` and then switch user to `root` i.e `sudo su -`.

  * By referring [digital ocean url](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-10-on-ubuntu-20-04) install apache tomact 10 (to install tomcat first we need to install java)
  
    - **Update the local package**:
        * `sudo apt update`

    - **Create Tomcat user and provide access to /opt/tomcat dir**: 
        * `sudo useradd -m -d /opt/tomcat -U -s /bin/false tomcat`
            - **Note**: By supplying `/bin/false` as the user’s default shell, you ensure that it’s not possible to log in as `tomcat`.
    - Install java openjdk 20 i.e `sudo apt install openjdk-20-jdk`
        * check java version**: `java --version`
  
    - **navigate to the /tmp directory**:
        * `cd /tmp`
  
    - **Download the archive using wget by running the following command**:
        * `wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.0.20/bin/apache-tomcat-10.0.20.tar.gz`
            - unable to download using above url now get to [official url](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi) and download the `core tar.gz` file i.e `https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.55/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.55.tar.gz`
            - **Note**: The `wget` command downloads resources from the Internet.

        * Extract the archive you downloaded by running `sudo tar xzvf apache-tomcat-10*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1`. ![preview](Images/tomcat1.png)
            - **Note**: `--strip-components=1` extracts the internal contents directly into /opt/tomcat instead of creating an extra nested folder like `/opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-11.0.22/`

        * Since you have already created a user, you can now grant tomcat ownership over the extracted installation by running `sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/` and `sudo chmod -R u+x /opt/tomcat/bin`, now check the owner and group permissions i.e ![preview](Images/tomcat2.png)

    - **Now configure admin users**
        * To gain access to the Manager and Host Manager pages, you’ll define privileged users in Tomcat’s configuration. You will need to remove the IP address restrictions, which disallows all external IP addresses from accessing those pages.

        * Tomcat users are defined in `/opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`. Open the file for editing with the following command: `sudo nano /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`, now add the following lines before the ending tag

        ```xml
        <role rolename="manager-gui" />
        <user username="manager" password="manager_password" roles="manager-gui" />

        <role rolename="admin-gui" />
        <user username="admin" password="admin_password" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui" />
        ```
        * **Note**: Replace highlighted passwords with your own. When you’re done, save and close the file.

        * Here you define two user roles, manager-gui and admin-gui, which allow access to Manager and Host Manager pages, respectively. You also define two users, manager and admin, with relevant roles.

        * By default, Tomcat is configured to restrict access to the admin pages, unless the connection comes from the server itself. To access those pages with the users you just defined, you will need to edit config files for those pages.

        * To remove the restriction for the Manager page, open its config file for editing i.e `sudo nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml`, ![preview](Images/tomcat3.png)

        * Save and close the file, then repeat for Host Manager i.e `sudo nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml` ![preview](Images/tomcat4.png)

        * You have now defined two users, manager and admin, which you will later use to access restricted parts of the management interface. You’ll now create a systemd service for Tomcat.

    - **Creating a systemd service**
        * The systemd service that you will now create will keep Tomcat quietly running in the background. The systemd service will also restart Tomcat automatically in case of an error or failure.

        * Tomcat, being a Java application itself, requires the Java runtime to be present, which you installed with the JDK. Before you create the service, you need to know where Java is located. You can look that up by running the following command  `sudo update-java-alternatives -l` ![preview](Images/tomcat5.png)

        * Now you need the path momentarily to define the service. Need to store the tomcat service in a file named `tomcat.service`, under `/etc/systemd/system`. Create the file for editing by running `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service` 
            - **note**: Modify the  JAVA_HOME if it differs from the one you noted previously by the command used `sudo update-java-alternatives -l`
        ```tomcat.service
        [Unit]
        Description=Tomcat

        Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom"
        Environment="CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat"
        Environment="CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat"
        Environment="CATALINA_PID=/opt/tomcat/temp/tomcat.pid"
        Environment="CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC"

        ExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
        ExecStop=/opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh

        RestartSec=10
        Restart=always

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        ```
        * Here, you define a service that will run Tomcat by executing the startup and shutdown scripts it provides. You also set a few environment variables to define its home directory (which is /opt/tomcat as before) and limit the amount of memory that the Java VM can allocate (in CATALINA_OPTS). Upon failure, the Tomcat service will restart automatically

        * Reload the systemd daemon so that it becomes aware of the new service `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, now start the Tomcat service and check the status i.e `sudo systemctl start tomcat` and `sudo systemctl status tomcat`, the output should look like ![preview](Images/tomcat6.png)

    - **Accessing the Web Interface**
        * Now that the Tomcat service is running, you can configure the firewall to allow connections to Tomcat. Then, you will be able to access its web interface. Tomcat uses port 8080 to accept HTTP requests, now run this command to allow traffic `sudo ufw allow 8080`

        * To enable Tomcat starting up with the system, run the following command `sudo systemctl enable tomcat`, now access Tomcat through your web browser i.e `http://PUBLIC-IPADDRESS:8080`, ![preview](Images/tomcat7.png)

        * You should also be able to navigate to **Manager App** and **Host Manager**. When you click on both Manager App and Host Manager it will prompt for user and password (look for user & passwd when you configured `/opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`) then you will navigate to their respective pages.

##### **Exercise: Manual steps to install Apache Tomcat 10 with openjdk 21 on RedHat instance**
  * Create a redhat instance naming `redhat-tomcat-manual` (or choose name of your choice) and attach existing .pem key or create one if you dont have one and then enable `http(80)` and `https(443)` protocals. Later after launching instance try to edit inbound security rule enable `port 8080` since tomcat runs on port 8080. 

  * Now `ssh` into the redhat machine using <PUBLIC_IPADDRESS> i.e `ssh -i /User/jagadeesh/Downloads/ansible-keypair ec2-user@54.210.155.84` and then switch user to `root` i.e `sudo su -`.
  * **Steps for installing Apache Tomcat 10**
    - Update the local packages `sudo dnf update -y`
    - Create Tomcat user and provide access to `/opt/tomcat/` dir, i.e `sudo useradd -r -m -U -d /opt/tomcat -s /sbin/nologin tomcat`
        * `/sbin/nologin` over `/bin/false` is both effectively block shell login access. However, /sbin/nologin is the standard convention in Red Hat. It politely logs a message stating the account is unavailable if a user attempts a login.
        * `-m` forces the creation of the home directory.
        * `-d /opt/tomcat` explicitly points the home directory path to your Tomcat installation.
        * `-U` automatically creates a user group with the matching name tomcat.
        * **Note**: ensure you change the ownership of that directory right after creating the user by running `sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat`.
    - Install java openjdk 21 i.e `sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk-devel`
        * **Note**: If you not include `-devel` Red Hat will only download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). For production-ready web application servers like Tomcat, you specifically need the `-devel` suffix to supply the complete development tools and compilers (javac).
    - **check java version**: `java --version`
    - **Navigate to the /tmp directory**: `cd /tmp`
    - **Download the archive using wget**
        * Download the `tar.gz` i.e `wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.55/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.55.tar.gz` 
            - **Note**: Make sure you install `wget` before you run above command i.e `sudo dnf install wget -y`
        * Extract the archive you downloaded by running `sudo tar xzvf apache-tomcat-10*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1`. ![preview](Images/tomcat10.png)
            - **Note**: `--strip-components=1` extracts the internal contents directly into /opt/tomcat instead of creating an extra nested folder like `/opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-11.0.22/`
        * Since you have already created a user, you can now grant tomcat ownership over the extracted installation by running `sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/` and `sudo chmod -R u+x /opt/tomcat/bin`, now check the owner and group permissions i.e ![preview](Images/tomcat11.png)

        * To gain access to the Manager and Host Manager pages, you’ll define privileged users in Tomcat’s configuration. You will need to remove the IP address restrictions, which disallows all external IP addresses from accessing those pages.
        * Tomcat users are defined in `/opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`. Open the file for editing with the following command: `sudo nano /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`, now add the following lines before the ending tag
            - **Note**: By default `nano` editor doesn't exists in redhat you can install by using `sudo dnf install nano -y` or use `vim` editor.
        ```xml
        <role rolename="manager-gui" />
        <user username="manager" password="manager_password" roles="manager-gui" />

        <role rolename="admin-gui" />

##### **Exercise: Manual steps to install Jenkins Application inside Tomcat server**
  * **Note**: Increase the instance size to t3.medium because we want to deploy two applications i.e **Jenkins** and **Spring petClinic** 

  * By referring Jenkins [WAR file page](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/war-file/) copy the war file and run wget command with that war file inside `/opt/tomcat/webapps` i.e `wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.555.3/jenkins.war`

  * Now run the command `java -jar jenkins.war`, Got the error while running this command ![preview](Images/tomcat19.png)

  * You are getting an error because you are mixing two different deployment methods. By placing `jenkins.war` inside Tomcat's `/webapps/` folder, Tomcat automatically extracts and runs it; running `java -jar jenkins.war` manually at the same time triggers Jenkins' built-in web server (Winstone), creating a severe port conflict since both try to claim port 8080

  * There are two different deployment methods:
    - **Let Tomcat Handle It**
      * Ensure tomcat is stopped i.e `sudo systemctl stop tomcat.service` and then check the status of the tomcat service i.e `sudo systemctl status tomcat.service` - It is inactive (stopped)
        - **Note**: If you just want to see if port 8080 is free, use `sudo ss -tulnp | grep :8080` (RedHat) and `sudo lsof -i :8080` (Ubuntu)
      * Tomcat will automatically unpack the WAR file and deploy it, now access jenkins via your browser i.e http://YOUR-SERVER-PUBLIC-IPADDRESS:8080/jenkins (Its better to access with PRIVATE-IP)because the public ip keeps changing when you stop and start the instance.
        - Getting error **This site can’t be reached” or “Connection Timed Out”**
          * Red Hat enterprise operating systems have a built-in firewall active by default that blocks incoming traffic on port 8080 unless you explicitly open it, run the following commands to permanently allow traffic through port 8080
            ```
            sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
            sudo firewall-cmd --reload
            ```
          * Verify Tomcat is actually listening or not i.e `sudo ss -tulnp | grep :8080` -> yes, now goto browser and give http://YOUR-SERVER-PUBLIC-IPADDRESS:8080/jenkins ![preview](Images/tomcat20.png) 

          * Now after pasting the password -> choose install suggested plugins -> now enter the required details and click save and continue -> under **instance configuration** now provide http://YOUR-SERVER-PRIVATE-IPADDRESS:8080/jenkins/ -> now you can see the **Jenkins Home Page**. ![preview](Images/tomcat21.png)
      
    - **Run Jenkins Standalone**
      * To run jenkins standalone using `java -jar`, you need to move from tomcat directory to avoid further conflicts. Move the jenkins war file to different directory `mv /opt/tomcat/webapps/jenkins.war /opt/jenkins/`
      * un the standalone command (and specify a different port if Tomcat is already running on 8080) i.e `java -jar /opt/jenkins/jenkins.war --httpPort=8081`
      * Access Jenkins via your browser at http://YOUR-SERVER-PRIVATE-IPADDRESS:8081 

##### **Exercise: Manual steps to Spring PetClinic Application inside Tomcat server**

  * **Install Git and Maven Dependencies**
      - Ensure your Red Hat system has Git and a Java Development Kit i.e `sudo dnf install git java-21-openjdk-devel -y`
  * **Clone the Project**
      - Navigate to cd /opt/tomcat/ and clone the repository directly from GitHub i.e `sudo git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git` -> now navigate to springpetclinic dir i.e `cd spring-petclinic`, now give the owner permissions for the user and group, since i have tomcat as user and group im assigning the same i.e `sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/spring-petclinic/` and `sudo chmod -R u+x /opt/tomcat/spring-petclinic/` ![preview](Images/tomcat22.png)
  * **Build the Application Package**
      - Use the included Maven wrapper to compile the code and package it into a runnable .jar file i.e `./mvnw package -DskipTests`
  * **Run PetClinic Standalone on a Custom Port**
      - Once the build finishes, the executable file will be generated in the target/ directory. Run it while explicitly assigning it to port 8082 i.e `java -jar target/spring-petclinic-*.jar --server.port=8082` 
        * **Note**: check you enable custom TCP port 8082 under in-bound rule for the instance security group.
  * **Open the Firewall Port**: Run only when you encounter the page can't be reached.
      - Red Hat enterprise operating systems have a built-in firewall active by default that blocks incoming traffic on port 8082 (custom port) unless you explicitly open it, run the following commands to permanently allow traffic through port 8082 for **spring-petclinic**.
      ```
      sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8082/tcp --permanent
      sudo firewall-cmd --reload
      ```
      - **Note (How to stop it if you ever need to restart it)**: Run this command to port check tool to see the active background process holding onto port 8082 i.e `sudo ss -tulnp | grep :8082` -> you can see the **ProcessID** or other way is to run `sudo lsof -i :8082`, to kill it run `sudo kill -9 <PID>`

  * Now the SpringPetClinic is successfully running. ![preview](Images/tomcat23.png)

    │   └── all.yaml
    ├── inventory.ini

    │   └── tomcat.service.j2
    └── tomcat.yaml    
    ```

#### Ansible Roles 
  * **What are Ansible Roles?**
    * An Ansible Role is a standardized, modular way of organizing your playbooks. Instead of putting all your tasks, variables, files, and configurations into one massive, messy YAML file, a role breaks them down into a strict, predefined directory structure.
    * Think of a role as an independent, reusable blueprint for a specific technology (like installing Java, configuring a firewall, or deploying Apache Tomcat). Once written, a role can easily be shared across different projects, teams, or departments without needing modification.
  * **Why Use Roles?**
    * **Reusability**: You can write a role once (e.g., java21) and use it across ten different playbooks.
    * **Maintainability**: If a package name changes, you only fix it in one specific file instead of searching through thousands of lines of playbook code.
    * **Separation of Concerns**: Variables live in one place, tasks in another, and configuration files in another. This prevents "spaghetti code."
    * **Role Dependencies**: Roles can call other roles automatically (e.g., telling your tomcat10 role to automatically run the java21 role first).
  * **The Standard Role Directory Structure**
    * When you create a role using `ansible-galaxy role init <role_name>`, Ansible generates a fixed set of directories. Each folder has a very specific job:

      | Directory | File Location / Path | Scope & Common Usage |
      | :---: | :--- | :--- |
      | **`tasks/`** | `tasks/main.yml` | **The Core Engine:** Contains the primary, sequential list of automation steps and modules executed by the role. |
      | **`defaults/`** | `defaults/main.yml` | **Default Variables:** Stores low-priority configuration values (lowest variable precedence) intended for easy user overrides. |
      | **`vars/`** | `vars/main.yml` | **Internal Variables:** Stores high-priority constants and role-specific architecture logic that should never be overridden. |
      | **`handlers/`** | `handlers/main.yml` | **Triggered Service Tasks:** Holds conditional system operations (restarts/reloads) that execute only when called via `notify`. |
      | **`templates/`** | `templates/*.j2` | **Dynamic Blueprints:** Houses Jinja2 template configuration files processed with live variables before remote deployment. |
      | **`files/`** | `files/*` | **Static Assets:** Stores raw, unaltered files (scripts, certificates) copied directly to target nodes without processing. |
      | **`meta/`** | `meta/main.yml` | **Metadata & Dependencies:** Tracks author details, license configurations, supported platforms, and upstream role dependencies. |
      | **`tests/`** | `tests/inventory`<br>`tests/test.yml` | **Validation Sandbox:** Contains local inventory and minimal playbook references used to test the role standalone or in CI/CD. |

  * **Understanding Variable Precedence (Defaults vs. Vars)**
    * One of the most confusing parts of Ansible roles is knowing whether to put a variable in defaults/main.yml or vars/main.yml. Ansible uses strict ordering:
      * **`defaults/main.yml` (Lowest Priority)**: Use this for variables that act as configuration settings. For example, tomcat_port: 8080. A user running your role can easily change this to 8081 in their own playbook.
      * **`vars/main.yml` (Highest Priority)**: Use this for internal architecture logic that will break the system if changed. For example, if your role expects a specific lockfile path on Linux, define it here so a user cannot accidentally break it from the command line.
  * **How Roles Execute in a Playbook Wrapper**
    * Roles cannot run by themselves because they do not contain a `hosts:` definition. They require a small external playbook wrapper (like `deploy_tomcat.yml`) to give them context:
    ```yml
    ---
    - name: Deploy Infrastructure
      hosts: webservers
      become: yes

      roles:
        - java21
        - tomcat10
    ```
    * When this playbook runs, Ansible takes the webservers inventory group and executes the entire java21 role from start to finish, and then immediately transitions into executing the tomcat10 role on those exact same servers.

#### Ansible Galaxy
  * 

##### Creating Ansible roles to implement an Apache Tomcat installation.
  * Creating the Role: Use the command `ansible-galaxy role init <role_name>` to automatically generate the standard Ansible directory structure i.e ansible-galaxy role init tomcat10
  * Installing the Tree Utility: To view the generated folder structure as a visual tree, install the utility tool using sudo apt install tree on Ubuntu, or sudo dnf install tree on Red Hat. ![preview](Images/tree1.png)

  * **Note**: Ensure you have Ansible installed before executing any `ansible-galaxy` commands. Since Ansible is already configured on the remote control node, you can verify its availability by checking the galaxy version. If you prefer to run `ansible-galaxy` commands directly from your local machine, you must first install the Ansible package using Homebrew (`brew update && brew install ansible`) and confirm the installation by running `ansible-galaxy --version`. ![preview](Images/ansible7.png)

  * Now make changes according to the folders (**Path: Ansible(repository)/ansible-roles/tomcat10/** <-- where you can see all these directories)
    - When you generate an Ansible Role using ansible-galaxy, it creates a standardized file layout. Each directory contains a main.yml file designed for a specific purpose.
      * `defaults` Directory: The `defaults/main.yml` file is used to store centralised, low-priority variables. These are the default configuration values for your role that can easily be overridden by a user if needed.
        * **Use clear variable names**: Prefix variables if necessary to avoid conflict with other roles.
        * **Keep paths clean**: Avoid trailing slashes on directory variables to make joining paths predictable.
        ```yml
          #defaults file for tomcat10
          tomcat_website_url: https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.55/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.55.tar.gz
          group_name: tomcat
          user_name: tomcat 
          tomcat_home_directory: /opt/tomcat
          tomcat_shell: "{{ '/sbin/nologin' if ansible_os_family == 'RedHat' else '/bin/false' }}" 
          java_package: "{{ 'java-21-openjdk-devel' if ansible_os_family == 'RedHat' else 'openjdk-21-jdk' }}" 
          #java_home_path: /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk (passing dynamically from tomcat.yaml)
        ```
      * `handlers` Directory: Handlers are specialized tasks that only run when triggered by a notify statement from another task (e.g., restarting Tomcat only when a configuration file changes). They live inside `handlers/main.yml`.
        * **Syntax**: Because ansible-galaxy automatically wraps this directory's context, do not write the root key `handlers:` at the top of the file. Start your file directly with a list of tasks using `- name:`
        * **Correct Syntax** (`handlers/main.yml`):
        ```yml
          ---
          # handlers file for tomcat10
          - name: Reload and Restart systemd daemon
            ansible.builtin.systemd:
              name: "{{ user_name }}"
              state: restarted   
              enabled: yes      
              daemon_reload: true
        ```
      * `meta` Directory: The `meta/main.yml` file is used to store metadata about your role and to define its dependencies. This file is essential if you plan to share your role on Ansible Galaxy, but it is also highly useful for team collaboration and project tracking.
      * Inside `meta/main.yml`, you have two primary, top-level sections: galaxy_info and dependencies.
        * `galaxy_info` (Role Metadata): `min_ansible_version`, always specify this to prevent your playbook from crashing midway if someone runs it on an outdated, unsupported version of Ansible.
        * `galaxy_tags`: These act as keywords (like labels or search tags). They help people find your role on Ansible Galaxy and describe what platforms or technologies your role automates (e.g., web, tomcat, java).
        * `dependencies` (Role Requirements): The dependencies section allows you to list other Ansible roles that must run and succeed before your current role can execute. For example, since Tomcat requires Java to run, you can enforce that a Java role executes first.
        * **Critical Syntax & Behaviour Rules**:
          * One role per line: You must list each dependency as a standalone list element (- role: role_name) on its own line.
          * Execution Order: Ansible will automatically pause your tomcat role, download/execute the java role completely, and then return to finish your tomcat role.
          * Empty by Default: If your role does not rely on any external roles, leave it as an empty list (dependencies: [])
      * `tasks` Directory: The `tasks/main.yml` file is the core engine of your role. It contains the actual sequential list of steps (plays) required to execute your automation—in this case, installing and configuring the Apache Tomcat server for Linux nodes.
        * **Syntax**: Because ansible-galaxy automatically wraps this directory's context, do not write the root key tasks: at the top of the file. Your file must start directly with a list of tasks using the dash-name (`- name:`) syntax.
      * `templates` Directory: This folder holds Jinja2 templates (`.j2` files) that Ansible processes and deploys dynamically to your managed nodes using the `ansible.builtin.template` module in your tasks.
        * **Templates Required for Tomcat**: Place the following four files directly inside your `templates/` folder
          * `tomcat.service.j2` – The systemd service file template to manage the Tomcat process background lifecycle.
          * `tomcat-users.xml.j2` – The user configuration template to manage GUI administrative roles and passwords.
          * `manager_context.xml.j2` – The context file template to configure access restrictions for the Web Application Manager application.
          * `host_manager_context.xml.j2` – The context file template to configure access restrictions for the Host Manager application.
      * `tests` Directory: The `tests/` folder contains a self-contained environment to validate and test your role locally or within a CI/CD pipeline. It contains two main components: inventory and test.yml.
        * To maintain DevOps best practices, do not modify the `test.yml` file itself. Instead, keep it as a clean reference template and manage your targets using the inventory file or external environment playbooks.
        * **Configuring the tests/inventory File**: To ensure your Ansible control node connects seamlessly to your worker nodes without throwing connection or host-key checking errors, you should define your target nodes along with their explicit SSH credentials directly inside the inventory file
        ```ini
          [redhat_nodes]
          172.31.30.244
          172.31.30.237

          [ubuntu_nodes]
          172.31.22.136
          172.31.28.20

          [all:vars]
          ansible_user=ansible
          ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/ansible_key
        ```
      * `vars` Directory: Unlike the variables you put in `defaults/main.yml` (which are low-priority and meant to be changed by the user), variables placed in `vars/main.yml` have a very high priority in Ansible. You should use this folder for strict, internal role configurations that must not be modified at the command line or by external playbooks.
  
  * Create a new file named deploy_tomcat.yml to define your main play and call your role. This playbook must be placed in the parent directory alongside your tomcat10 role folder (ansible-roles/deploy_tomcat.yml), not inside it.
    * The deploy_tomcat.yml looks like:
    ```yml
      ---
      # The playbook.yml file should be located in the root directory alongside the tomcat10 role definition.
      - name: Deploy Apache Tomcat Server on Linux (Redhat/Ubuntu) Nodes
        hosts: "{{ chosen_servers | default('redhat_nodes,ubuntu_nodes') }}"
        gather_facts: true
        become: yes

        roles:
          - role: tomcat10
    ```
  * From your current working directory (`Ansible/ansible-roles`), ensure that both the `tomcat10` role folder and the `deploy_tomcat.yml` playbook are located in this same folder. Next, execute the deployment by running `ansible-playbook -i tomcat10/tests/inventory deploy_tomcat.yml`, which will generate the output shown in the screenshot. ![preview](Images/tomcat24.png)
      
  * **Note**: **when do you actually use `remote_src: yes`**
    * You only use `remote_src`: yes when the file already exists on the target node itself, and you want to move or duplicate it to another folder on that exact same machine.
      * Without `remote_src: yes` (Default): Ansible looks for the file on your Ansible control machine and uploads it to the target node.
      * With `remote_src: yes`: Ansible bypasses your control machine completely. It looks for the file directly on the target node, copies it, and pastes it into the new destination on that same target node.
    * **Example**:
      * If you download a Tomcat `.tar.gz` archive directly onto your target Red Hat or Ubuntu node using a `get_url` task, the file now lives on that remote node. To unarchive or copy it to `/opt/tomcat`, you must use `remote_src: yes` because the file is already on the remote server, not on your Ansible control machine.

  * **Create the java21 role and integrate it into the existing `deploy_tomcat.yml` playbook**
    * **Initialize the Java 21 Role**:
      * Navigate to `ansible-roles/` directory and generate the default role structure for your Java installation i.e `ansible-galaxy role init java21`
      * **Note**: This command automatically creates the standard layout of subdirectories, each containing an empty main.yml file.
    * **Configure Dynamic Variables in `java21`**:
      * Open `java21/defaults/main.yml` and define your package variable using an inline Jinja2 conditional statement. This ensures the correct package name is resolved dynamically at runtime based on the target system's operating system family i.e
      ```yml
      ---
      # java21/defaults/main.yml
      java_package: "{{ 'java-21-openjdk-devel' if ansible_os_family == 'RedHat' else 'openjdk-21-jdk' }}"
      ```
    * **Define the Installation Tasks in `java21`**
      * Open `java21/tasks/main.yml`. Move your Java setup logic out of the Tomcat role and place the multi-OS installation steps here. This configuration ensures that both Java 21 and wget are installed cleanly on your nodes.
      ```yml
        ---
        - name: Install dependencies on Red Hat-based systems
          ansible.builtin.dnf:
            name:
              - "{{ java_package }}"
              - wget
            state: present

    * **Add Metadata to the `java21 Role`**
      * Open `java21/meta/main.yml` to supply role identification details. Update the `galaxy_info` block to include your information. If this standalone role does not depend on any other automation layers, ensure the dependencies block remains an empty list.
      ```yml
      galaxy_info:
        author: jagadeesh
        description: java21 package installation for Debian/RedHat
        company: your company (optional)

        license: license (GPL-2.0-or-later, MIT, etc)

        min_ansible_version: "2.2"

        galaxy_tags: []

      dependencies: []
      ```
    * **Update the tomcat10 Role and Dependencies**
      * To prevent configuration drift and set up your execution hierarchy, you must modify your existing Tomcat role components:
        * **Remove Duplicate Variables**: Open `tomcat10/defaults/main.yml` and delete the old `java_package` definition, as it is now centrally managed by the Java role.
        * **Remove Old Tasks**: Open `tomcat10/tasks/main.yml` and delete the old plays previously used to install Java on Debian and Red Hat machines.
        * **Declare the Role Dependency**: Open `tomcat10/meta/main.yml`. Scroll down to the dependencies section and map your newly created role. This forces Ansible to download and fully execute java21 on the worker nodes before running any Tomcat configuration steps.
        ```yml
        dependencies:
          - role: java21
        ```
    * **Update the Test Suite Reference (Optional Best Practice)**
      * Open `tomcat10/tests/test.yml` and append java21 to the roles list to maintain an accurate local reference blueprint
      ```yml
      roles:
        - java21
        - tomcat10
      ```
    * **Executing the Playbook**
      * With both roles integrated, execute your main deployment playbook wrapper from the root of your project directory.
        * **Target Only Red Hat Worker Nodes Dynamically**: Pass your host tracking parameter as an extra variable via the command line interface to restrict execution (execute the command from `Ansible/ansible-roles`)i.e `ansible-playbook -i tomcat10/tests/inventory deploy_tomcat.yml -e "chosen_servers=redhat_nodes"`
        * **Run on All Available Inventory Nodes**: You can run the following command i.e `ansible-playbook -i tomcat10/tests/inventory deploy_tomcat.yml`.

  * **Installing java role from `geerlingguy.java` and integrate it into the existing `deploy_tomcat.yml` playbook**

    * **How to download a Java role from online**:
      * The most popular and trusted Java role in the Ansible community is written by an author named **geerlingguy**.
      * To download it without breaking your current workspace, run this command in your terminal (`Ansible/ansible-roles`): `ansible-galaxy role install geerlingguy.java`
      * Ansible will automatically download this role from the online hub and save it into a global folder on your Mac (usually under `~/.ansible/roles/`). Because it is saved globally, your playbooks can see it, but it stays completely separate from your custom folders.
    * **How to attach this downloaded role to your tomcat10 role**:
      * To link this specific online role to your Tomcat deployment, you must declare it as an upstream dependency.
      * Open your `tomcat10/meta/main.yml` file, go to the dependencies: section at the bottom, and type the exact name of the online role you just downloaded:
      ```yml
      dependencies:
        - role: geerlingguy.java
      ```
    * **How to pass your custom Java 21 config to the online role**
      * Since community roles are designed to be generic, they usually default to installing Java 11 or Java 8. To force geerlingguy.java to install Java 21 using your specific parameters, you pass your custom variables directly inside that same dependency block.
      * Update your **`tomcat10/meta/main.yml`** dependency section to look like this:
      ```yml
      dependencies:
        - role: geerlingguy.java
          vars:
            java_packages:
              - "{{ 'java-21-openjdk-devel' if ansible_os_family == 'RedHat' else 'openjdk-21-jdk' }}"
      ```
    * Make sure you have removed the config related `- role: java21` and replace with `- role: geerlingguy.java` i.e you have to make changes to 
      1. **`ansible-roles/tomcat10/meta/main.yml`**
        ```yml
        dependencies: 
          # List your role dependencies here, one per line. Be sure to remove the '[]' above,
          # if you add dependencies to this list.
          # - role: java21
          - role: geerlingguy.java
            vars:
              java_packages:
                - "{{ 'java-21-openjdk-devel' if ansible_os_family == 'RedHat' else 'openjdk-21-jdk' }}" # Defining java package that need to be installed on RedHat/Ubuntu.
        ```
      2. **`ansible-roles/tomcat10/tests/test.yml`**
        ```yml
        ---
        - hosts: localhost
          remote_user: root
          roles:
            - tomcat10
            # - java21 # Disabling custom created role
            - geerlingguy.java # Adding pre-installed role from geerlingguy
        ```
      3. **`ansible-roles/deploy_tomcat.yml`**
        ```yml
        roles:
          - role: tomcat10
          # - role: java21
          # - role: geerlingguy.java # You no need to mention this role as you can already defined under dependecy of tomcat10 role
        ```
    * **How it executes now**
      * When you run your main deploy_tomcat.yml playbook, Ansible reads the Tomcat metadata, pauses, jumps out to execute the downloaded geerlingguy.java role to install Java 21 across your nodes, and then seamlessly returns to run your Tomcat tasks. You can use `ansible-playbook -i tomcat10/tests/inventory deploy_tomcat.yml`
