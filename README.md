# DevOps standard tools concepts and implementations

## Configuration Management

* *Configuration Management (CM)* is an IT process that ensures all software and hardware systems maintain a consistent desired state. It automates the setup, maintenance, and tracking of servers and infrastructure, eliminating manual errors and configuration drifts.

* To be more detailed, an egineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements design and operational information throughtout its life.

* Types of Configuration Management
    * Configuration Management tools generally falls into two main operational categories based on how they apply updates:

    - Push Based Configuration Management
        * Master server pushes configuration directly to target nodes.
        * Target system do not need to pull updates.
        * Requires `SSH` or `WinRM` access to targets.
        * Example: **Ansible**.
            - **[Ansible](https://ansible.com):**
                * Architecture: Agentless.
                * Language: YAML.
                * Control: Push-based over `SSH`.
    
    - Pull Based Configuration Management
        * Agents installed on target nodes periodically check a master server.
        * Agents pull down the latest configuration if changes occur.
        * More scalable for massive environments.
        * Example: **Puppet, Chef**.
            - **[Puppet](https://puppet.com):**
                * Architecture: Agent-master.
                * Language: Puppet DSL (Domain Specific Language).
                * Control: Pull-based.
            - **[Chef](https://chef.io):**
                * Architecture: Angent-master.
                * Language: Rubby-based DSL.
                * Control: Pull-based.
            - **[SaltStack](https://saltproject.io):**
                * Architecture: Master-minion (can be agentless).
                * Language: Phython/YAML
                * Control: Speed focused push/pull via ZeroMQ.

### Ansible           

* Ansible is a open-source automation platform sponsored by Red Hat. It is highly popular due to its low barrier to entry and simple architecture.

* **Key Characteristics** 
    - **Agentless**: No software needs to be installed on target nodes.
    - **Idempotent**: Running a script multiple times yields excat same result without repeating completed tasks.
    - **Declarative/Procedural Hybrid**: You define the desired state, Ansible figures out how to achieve it.

* **Use Cases**
    - **Configuration Management**: Istall/Update package manager, manage files and services
        * Debian -> Ubuntu, debian, .. etc (`apt` package manager).
        * Redhat -> CentOS, redhat linux, amazon linux, ..etc (`yum` or `dnf`).
        * Windwos -> `choco` or `winget`.
    - **Application Deployment**: Deploys application code in multiple server.
        * Example: Deploys artifacts to tomcat webserver.
    - **Orchestration**: Ansible handles orchestration by executing automated steps in a strict, step by step order accross multiple servers form a single central machine.
        * Example: Setting up kubernetes cluster.
    - **Provisioning**: Creates resources in any cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP).

* **Core Concepts**    
    - **Control Node**: The machine where Ansible is installed and executed from.
    - **Managed/Worker Nodes**: The target servers managed by the control node.
    - **inventory**: A file (hosts) listing the IP addresses/domains of managed nodes.
    - **Modules**: Small plugins that execute specific tasks (e.g., installing a package, copying a file).
    - **Playbooks**: `YAML` file where automation tasks are defined and ordered.
    - **Ad-hoc**: Adhoc command is a single, quick task run directly from your terminal using the `ansible` command. It is used to perform immediate actions, like. checking server disk space or restarting a service-without writing a formal automation script (playbook).
        Example: `ansible all -m ping` used to check if servers are reachable.

* **Ansible Architecture**:

    - *Note*: 
        * We need to create users and provide sudo permissions both on ansible server as well as on worker nodes.
        * Their is a file called `known_hosts` which lies inside `.ssh` directory, it is a local database that stores the unique public keys (host keys) of all remote servers you have previously connected via `ssh`.

* **Core Requirements**
    - **Control Node**: A system running Linux, MacOS, or WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) with *python 3.9* or newer installed.
    - **Ansible Package**: Installed on the control node, typically via `pip` (Python's package installer) or your OS's package manager.
    - **Target Nodes**: The remote server or devices you want to chnage. They only require: 
        * A running `SSH` server.
        * A user account with permissions to execute commands (and often sudo privileges of system-level changes)
        * Python3 installed (to run complex modules).
    - **Target accessibility**: The control node must be able to resolve th hostnames and IP addresses of the target node and reach them over the network (usually via port22).

#### Ansible Environment Setup (AWS)

##### Using 3 ubuntu instances (`ubuntu-ansible-server`, `ubuntu-worker-1`, `ubuntu-worker-2`)

* **Create Ansible Server**: 
    - sign in to  the AWS Management Console.
    - Go to **EC2 Dashboard** and click Launch Instance.
    - Enter the instance name as `ubuntu-ansible-server`.
    - Select Ubuntu as operating system.
    - Choosen the required instance type (auto-selected free-tier).
* **Configure the Key Pair**:
    - Select an exisiting key pair or create a new one.
    - A key pair is used to securely connect to your EC2 instance using `SSH`.
* **Configure Network Settings**:
    - if you want the instance to be in a specific environment, choose the required **VPC**. Otherwise, use the default VPC.
    - Select an existing security group or create a new one.
    - Allow SSH (port 22) so you can connect to the instance.
    - if you plan to host a website, then allow:
        * HTTP (Port 80)
        * HTTPS (Port 443)
* **Launch the Instance**:
    - Review the settings and click Launch Instance.
* **Create Worker Nodes**:
    - Repeat the same process to create two additional Ubuntu instances
        * ubuntu-worker-1
        * ubuntu-worker-2
* At the end of the setup, you should have, 1 Ansible Server (`ubuntu-ansible-server`) and 2 Worker Nodes (`ubuntu-worker-1` & `ubuntu-worker-2`).
* **Connect to the Ansible Server**:
    - Use your .pem file (key) to connect to the `ubuntu-ansible-server` instance. i.e ssh -i /Users/jagadeesh/Downloads/ansible-keypair.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
    - *Note*: Before getting into further step first we need to do update and upgrade the linux system i.e `sudo apt update`
* **Create the Anisble User**:
    - Create a new user named `ansible`, i.e `sudo adduser ansible`.
        * When prompted for a password, you can use `ansible@123` (any passwd of your choice).
        * Re-enter the password to confirm.
        * Press Enter for the remaining optional fields (Name, ..etc).
        * Type Y when asked if the infomation is correct.
* **Add the User to Sudo Group**:
    - `sudo adduser ansible sudo`
    - To verify if the user has been added to sudo group, give `groups ansible`
* **Grant Passwordless Sudo Access**:
    - Create a Sudoers file:
    `sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
    - you will navigate to vim editor, now press `i` to enter insert mode and add:
        * `ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`
    - Save and exit by pressing `Esc` and type `wq!`
* **Set Read Permissions**:
    - Now set read permissions for user and group i.e `sudo chmod 400 /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
* **Enable Password Authentication for the Ansible User**:
    - Create and edit the SSH configuration file i.e `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-password-login-for-special-user.conf`
    - Add the following:
        ```nano
        Match User ansible
            PasswordAuthentication yes
        ```
    Save the file and exit.
* **Restart the SSH Service**:
    - `sudo systemctl restart ssh.service`
* **Verify the configuration**:
    - From the server (ubuntu<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>), try logging in as the `ansible` user i.e `sudo ssh ansible@<PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS>`. When prompted, enter the password. If the login succeeds, the configuration is working correctly.
* **Repeat on the Worker Nodes**:
    - `ubuntu-worker-1`
    - `ubuntu-worker-2`
    - *Note*: You can skip the following command on the worker nodes i.e `sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/ansible`
* **Install Python on All Instances**:
    - Why ansible require python on all the instances?
        * **Server Execution**: The Ansible software itself is written in Python and needs it on the server to read your playbooks and manage connections
        * **Node Execution**: Ansible works by pushing temporary scripts (modules) to the nodes; the nodes need Python to run these scripts locally.
        * **Communication**: The Python scripts running on the nodes gather system data and format the results into JSON to send back to the server.
    - Ansible uses Python on the managed (worker) nodes to execute modules and ad-hoc commands. Therefore, Python should be installed on all instances
        * Ansible Server (Control Node)
        * Worker Node 1 
        * Worker Node 2
    - **Update the Package of the OS (Ubuntu)**
    Run the following command on each instance
    `sudo apt update`
    - **Install Python3 and pip**
        * `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y`, `-y` automatically answers "Yes" to the installation prompts.
        * Now verify the Python version, you should see the latest version of Python.
            `python3 --version`
* **Install Ansible on the Control Node**:
    - Ansible follows a push-based architecture, meaning the control node connects to worjer nodes over SSH and executes tasks remotely. Therefore, Ansible only needs to be installed on the Ansible Server (Control Node).
    - Run the following commands on Ansible Server Node:
        ```
        sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
        sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
        sudo apt install ansible -y
        ```
    - Verify the version of Ansible
        `ansible --version`, you should see the latest version of Ansible.
* **Configure Passwordless SSH Authentication**:        
    - To allow the Ansible to connect to worker nodes without enterning a password each time, configure SSH Key-based authentication.
    - **Generate an SSH Key Pair**
        * Log in as the `ansible` user on the Ansible Server Node and generate a new key pair i.e `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/ansible_key`, Press Enter to accept the default prompts if no passphrase is required.
        * This creates:
            - `~/.ssh/ansible_key` -> Private Key (Keep this secure on the Ansible Server)
            - `~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub` -> Public Key (copy this to worker nodes)
* **Copy the Public Key to Worker Nodes**:
    - Copy the public key to worker node 1 & 2
    `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub ansible@<worker-1-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>` and `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key.pub ansible@<worker-2-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>`. Enter the `ansible` user's password when prompted. The publiv key will be added to the worker node's `authorized_keys` file.
    - *Note*: Why use the <PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS> ?
    Since all instances are in the same AWS VPC. they can communicate using their private IP addresses. Using private IPs avoids issues caused by changing public IPs when re-starting the instances and also keeps traffic within the AWS network
* **Verify Passwordless SSH Access**:
    - From the Ansible Server, test connectivity to rach worker node i.e `ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key ansible@<worker-1-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>` and `ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible_key ansible@<worker-2-PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>`. If the configuration is correct, you should log in without being prompted for the `ansible` user's password.
    - *Note*: If you generated the SSH Key while logged in as `ubuntu`, switch to the `ansible` user (`su ansible`) and generate the key there. This keeps the key in the `ansible` user's home directory and makes it easier for Ansible to use it.
